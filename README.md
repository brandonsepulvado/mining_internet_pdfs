# mining_internet_pdfs

This repository hosts code for a workshop on Monday, 27 August 2018, dedicated to gathering data from the internet. The goal is to get text from PDFs of opinions (roughly 130) released by the French Comité Consultatif National d'Éthique (CCNE) without having to download manually the PDF files and ideally without having to download at all the PDF files. Relatively introductory in nature, this code does not cover crawling frameworks; rather, I (for the time being) strategically scrape a small set of pages.
